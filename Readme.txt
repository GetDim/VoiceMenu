Voice Menu for Visually Impaired   Menu.html

I tried to make an application for visually impaired people. This is a good start, I suppose. Only works with Google Chrome and Windows. (Other browsers may be added as well). Narrator is not needed.

Any suggestions would be appreciated, specially incorporating other browsers.
