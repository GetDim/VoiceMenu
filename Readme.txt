Voice Menu for Visually Impaired   Menu.html

I tried to make an application for visually impaired people. This is a good start, I suppose. Only works with Google Chrome and Windows. (Other browsers may be added as well). Narrator is not needed.
8/16/2019 Added Voice Editor button (works in En and BG)

Any suggestions would be appreciated, specially incorporating other browsers.

I have VLC media Player
When you open VLC click on Media and select Quit at the end of playlist.
this will close the player after each item selected. 
ALT F4 works also if you can't setup the player.
